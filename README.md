# Quantum-Repeater-using-Quantum-Circuits
Implementing a complete Quantum Repeater using Quantum Circuits, and, benchmarking its performance on the IBM Quantum Experience platform.

Relevant python codes/notebooks for Channel-Length Simulation, Entanglement Swapping, Entanglement Purification and implementing a nested 1-stage Quantum Repeater with a 3-qubit Purification code can be found in the main branch. Raw simulation data of experimenting on the IBMQ Melbourne platform can be found in the "simulation results" folder.
